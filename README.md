# 🥥 Cassava Chronicles: A FAO-tastic Data Adventure 🌍📊 
This text was partially created with AI but aproved by me! 

Welcome to this *rooty* little project, where I went full data archeologist and dug through the FAO website to extract the ancient scrolls of cassava knowledge. 🧾🔍

## 🧪 What is this?

This repository is an experiment I did for fun, science, and a proyect for the masters... that I did not even present :(. The idea was simple:

> "What if I download a bunch of cassava-related data from FAO and try to make sense of it?"

And so I did. Multiple datasets, lots of manual labor, and a whole lot of cleaning later… here we are!

## 📁 What's in this repository?

- **📜 `Creacion.ipynb`**:  
  The spellbook where the final dataframe was born. This notebook walks through the process of merging, cleaning, and transforming FAO data into something actually useful. Think of it as a cassava Frankenstein lab. 🧬🥔

- **📊 `EDA.ipynb`**:  
  EDA = *Exploratory Data Analysis* (aka "Let's stare at charts until meaning appears"). Here I poked at the data to see what interesting things we could find. Plots were made. Questions were asked. Cassava truths were revealed. Well... at the end we can see that the only truth is that the FAO has really desconnected data! 📈🔮

## 🧰 Tools used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📦 Data source

All data came from [FAO.org](https://www.fao.org/faostat/es/#data), a.k.a. the global fridge of food statistics. I specifically went after everything cassava-related. Roots, production, exports, vibes — you name it. It was quite difficult to be honest... 

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This was an experiment. The code might not be elegant, optimized, or even emotionally stable. Use at your own risk (or delight). 💥
